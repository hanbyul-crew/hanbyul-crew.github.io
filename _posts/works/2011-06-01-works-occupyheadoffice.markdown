'Occupy Head Office' is the interactive media project against university's incorrigible decision to incorporate the university.

In the summer of 2011, Seoul National University, the university I attend, made an arbitrary decision to incorporate the university without asking the students’ opinions. In consequence, students engaged in a sit-in protest, occupying the school’s administrative building, until the school agreed to hold talks with them. The sit-in protest had a cheerful mood; students held small music events or made parody music videos of the university’s rash and corrupt decision. We also went to the administrative building every night and projected sarcastic images or students’ opinions as gathered from Twitter.
