'Break Me' is an interactive installation,responses to audiences' steps. 

This piece reflects our consideration about 'interaction', powerful, but can be destructive intrinsically. There is a box, which has some lights inside of it. When Audiences open the box, their faces are captured and saved in the system.Then, the face is shoot and projected on floors of stairs.Floor breaks when audiences step on it.Audiences can see their broken face projected on floor.Some color effects were added on the side of stairs to make interaction clear.
