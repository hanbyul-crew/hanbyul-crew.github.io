Joonhwan is Awesome is a site for prof.Lee (Joonhwan Lee) in Information Technology and Culture Technology major in Seoul Nation University 

Having a great mentor in life is super awesome, but rare oppurtunity to have. Since all of students of Joonhwan Lee had luck to have a great mentor like him, who is really supportive for his students and has a really cute smile, we decided to dedicate a site to him. Everyone really enjoyed the site. I grabbed some nice photos of Joonhwan and hacekd Facebook API and let all students admire him. Everyone could enjoy leaving flattering comments for him. Joonhwan, we love you!
