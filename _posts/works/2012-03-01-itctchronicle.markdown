ITCT Chronicle is data visualization which shows the history of Information Technology and Culture Technology (ITCT) major in Seoul National University. This data visualization is done to celebrate ITCT's 10 years anniversary.

There are largely two parts in the timeline, events part and students part. All the events and classes happend in ITCT were arranged on the left columnn. Since there are lots of events happend in same time, the event is arrnaged inside of the ball which represents specific month. If you click the ball, you can see all the events, you can also click the event to see the students who participated in the event. I assigned one line for each student, the beginning of the line shows when the student joined in the major, the end of the line shows when the student graduated. The line has node representing the event that they were in. It took a little bit longer time to graduate for me than for others, ITCT had been great shelter for my long undergraduate life. I and my friend Inho Won, really enjoyed the process of rearranging the history of ITCT.
